## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Video Games Sales Analysis
**Code:** [`AR_VR_Video_Game_Sales_prediction.ipynb`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fmBOaTRAdrbcOQcs4su-YQkCyk3R7v_1?usp=sharing)    
**Description:** The gaming industry is certainly one of the thriving industries of the modern age and one of those that are most influenced by the advancement in technology. With the availability of technologies like AR/VR in consumer products like gaming consoles and even smartphones, the gaming sector shows great potential. In this hackathon, you as a data scientist must use your analytical skills to predict the sales of video games depending on given factors. Given are 8 distinguishing factors that can influence the sales of a video game. Your objective as a data scientist is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sales in millions of units for a given game.
**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, central limit theorem, hypothesis testing, data visualization.  
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib.  
**Results:** prediction the sales of video games depending on given factors.

### OpenAI's Whisper
**Code:** [`OpenAI_Whisper_Demo`](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-Ofp1JZKS4FfpQrjUVfnTeJflXUMFSZH?usp=sharing)    
**Paper:** [`OpenAI.com/blog/whisper`](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/)   
**Description:** Whisper is an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data collected from the web. We show that the use of such a large and diverse dataset leads to improved robustness to accents, background noise and technical language. Moreover, it enables transcription in multiple languages, as well as translation from those languages into English. We are open-sourcing models and inference code to serve as a foundation for building useful applications and for further research on robust speech processing.  
**Skills:** API,data cleaning, detecting data anomalies, python coding, data visualization, descriptive statistics, dealing with outliers, A/B tests, Shapiro–Wilk test, Levene's test, data transforms, Mann–Whitney U test, proportions z-test, bootstrapping, defining metrics.    
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Scipy Stats, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels Stats, Bootstrap.     
**Results:** adding voice interfaces to a much wider set of applications.

### Online Advertising Campaign Analysis
**Code:** [`Analyzing_Marketing_Campaigns.ipynb `](https://github.com/itay-hilel/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/0fcf9890a78b7ef27959887b0e43fa217ed75327/Analyzing_Marketing_Campaigns_with_pandas.ipynb)     
**Description:** The analysis of fake marketing dataset based on the data of an online subscription business. Answering business questions like "How did this campaign perform?", "Which channel is referring the most subscribers?", "Why is a particular channel underperforming?" are answered using data from the analysis. This project is build on Python and pandas fundamentals, such as merging/slicing datasets, groupby(), correcting data types and visualizing results using matplotlib.
**Skills:** data cleaning, CTR, CPC, CPA and CR calculation, comparing metrics with competitors, visualizing results, drawing conclusions.    
**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.     
**Results:** Calculating list and significance testing Evaluating using t-test using 'stats.ttest_ind' from the scipy library Building and testing of A/B test segmenting function.

### Airbnb Listings Analytics 
**Tableau Public:** [`dashboard`](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/itay.hilel/viz/ItayHilel/Dashboard1#1)   
**Description:** Tableau Public dashboard consisted of: calculated renting property occupation rate; analytical chart to choose the best property by occupation rate, review score and price per night; a ranked table of top listings by calculated potential annual revenue; average price, average occupation rate and a number of unique listings KPIs; filters by neighborhood, occupation rate and a number of reviews per the last twelve month.    
**Skills:** interview with a customer, requirements capture, designing an analytical dashboard, product delivery.    
**Technology:** Tableau.    
**Results:** created an analytical dashboard to support daily activities of a company involved in apartments renting business. 

## Study Projects
In this section I will provide links to my github repositories containing code and jupyter notebooks I created while passing online courses or was just having fun with.
